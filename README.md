Project Name: Netflix Recommendation System

Abstract:

More than 80% of the TV shows people watch on Netflix are discovered through the platforms own recommendation system. This means the majority of what people 
decide to watch on Netflix is the result of the platforms machine learning recommender system. Netflix uses machine learning to help break viewers preconceived 
notions and finds content they might not else have chosen.
The goal of this project is to build a recommender system using a Netflix dataset and understand the steps and challenges involved. There are a number of 
useful machine learning libraries to implement machine learning models, however there is no direct library to create and build a recommend system. This project 
will encompass five stages of data overview, data clean and validation, exploratory data analysis, merging datasets and finally the build of the recommendation 
system.
A plot based content model was firstly built and while the model does a good job of finding titles with similar plot descriptions, the quality of these 
recommendations can be improved. It did not take account of say who directed the title and that someone may enjoy other titles by that director. Subsequently a 
content based recommender system taking the additional metrics of cast, director, country, rating and genres provides better quality results than solely relying 
on a descriptions based model.
